<h1>About</h1>

<p>Kendall Innovation is  a group of urban planners and architects, studying where people connect in cities and how cities can potentially foster social connections (and potentially collaboration and innovation).  Right now, we're focusing on the Kendall Square area in Cambridge, MA.</p>

<p>Located near MIT and anchored by one subway station, Kendall Square is considered the premier location for Biotech and IT innovation in New England. By identifying the patterns of interaction in an innovation cluster like this,, we intend to deepen the understanding of the use of physical space in centers of innovation.</p>

<p>Innovation is vital for economic growth and is, perhaps, the United States' primary market advantage.  Thought-leaders such as Edward Glaeser have argued that the dense concentration of people in cities fosters innovation by increasing the frequency of personal interaction and communication of ideas.  A chance meeting may spark the development of the next cancer drug or solve the next programming challenge.  What specific types of physical space promote this interaction?</p>

<p>In 1980, William Whyte produced a fascinating and groundbreaking film, The Social Life of Small Urban Spaces, which told the story of how public spaces are used by people.  His methodology was simple --  film people moving through these spaces.  What Whyte did more than 30 years ago can be updated and applied to the phenomenon of urban innovation. This map will provide a new way to collect data about where people typically congregate, what types of interactions they have in a given space, and where ideas are generated.  Knowing the role of space in interaction can guide future design to encourage productivity.</p>
