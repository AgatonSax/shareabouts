  href="http://www.openplans.org/">Open Plans</a> are collaborating to determine
  how transit stations can better accommodate bicyclists. This map will help
  identify where the demand for better bicycle facilities is greatest.</p>

<p>Please click on a station where you would like to see improvements, and
  respond to the questions that follow. You can choose a station you currently
  bike to, or one you would bike to if improvements were made. This map will be
  made available until December 1, 2012.</p>

<p>OpenPlans developed this map using its Shareabouts software, which is a tool
  to crowdsource data in a neighborhood or city.</p>
