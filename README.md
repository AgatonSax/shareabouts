Shareabouts is a simple web app for crowdsourced mapping. We're in very early stages right now, so expect many rough edges. See a dev version at http://shareabouts.dev.openplans.org.

Shareabouts is intended for simple mapping applications. For example, you could use it to collect public input on suitable locations for a bike share station.

The project is open source, and we welcome your involvement.
