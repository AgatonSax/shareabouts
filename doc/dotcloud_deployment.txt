Deploying Shareabouts on dotcloud.com
======================================

Install the dotcloud command line app and get a dotcloud API key.

First Deployment
=================

Then, from the root of your shareabouts source tree:

 dotcloud create shareabouts
 dotcloud push shareabouts .
 dotcloud run shareabouts.www -- rake -f current/Rakefile db:create db:migrate

That should take care of everything.

Note that if you have local changes to your shareabouts code,
you must commit them before running ``dotcloud push``.

If the build finishes but you get errors from the server, ssh in (by
doing "dotcloud ssh shareabouts1") and check
/home/dotcloud/current/log/production.log

Pushing Updates
================

From the root of your shareabouts source tree:

 dotcloud push shareabouts .
 dotcloud run shareabouts.www -- rake -f current/Rakefile db:migrate
