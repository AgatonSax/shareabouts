      <p>
        There is a lot going on in the Upper West Side&#39;s sidewalks. In order to create a more walkable, livable neighborhood, CB7 is collecting information about existing sidewalk objects.</p>
      <p>
        Every resident is a local expert! Please use this map to tell us about sidewalk clutter.</p>
      <p>
        Where are the benches, newsstands, and food trucks that overcrowd your street? Where are the bollards, planters, and trash baskets that block your way?</p>
      <p>
        Submit locations you know. With your help, we will all have a better understanding of sidewalk clutter in the Upper West Side.</p>
